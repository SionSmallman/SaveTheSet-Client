The frontend client of Save The Set, a web application for quickly and easily converting setlists from setlist.fm into Spotify playlists in the users account, with customization options.

## Features
- Quickly convert setlists from setlist.fm to Spotify playlists
- Customize the titles, description, privacy settings of the playlist.
- Edit the setlists to include what songs you'd like to include/exclude.
- Authentication through Spotify using OAuth2.

## Stack

The frontend is built using **React** with **Typescript**. **Tailwind CSS** is used as a CSS framework. Hosted on Vercel.

## Motivation

This was initially a python script I used personally to prepare for gigs I attended. However, after discussing with some friends who also had the desire for a quick way to add setlist.fm setlists directly to Spotify, I decided to turn the project into a web application for them and others to use.
